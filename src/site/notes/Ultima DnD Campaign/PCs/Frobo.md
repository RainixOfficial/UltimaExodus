### Quote

"Come friends, don't be so jelly-hearted!"

### [!Background]-`

Frobo, a Grippli dreaming of knighthood, spends his days practicing swordplay in the swamps of The Throng. His friend Lena, a human druid, brings news of a creature terrorizing local fishers. Torn between helping his community and participating in the Tournament at Castle Starfall—which could make his knightly dreams come true—Frobo hesitates. Lena suggests they tackle both: defeat the creature as a "knightly trial" before heading to the tournament. Inspired, Frobo agrees, and the duo sets off on their first adventure, leaving behind their familiar swamp for the promise of heroism and honor.
