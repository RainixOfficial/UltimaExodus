## Backstory

Lena, the self-proclaimed "Fish Whisperer," hails from the outskirts of [[the Throng\|the Throng]], a kingdom mostly known for its amphibian-like race. She believed her magical spear made her the de facto queen of fish until they started disappearing. Now armed with her spear, a belly full of laughs, and her amphibian ally [[Ultima DnD Campaign/PCs/Frobo\|Frobo]], she’s out to prove that she can do more than just talk to fish—she can save them too.
