### Grove's Journal

#### Entry 1: Day one at Frosthearth

Today was my first day in this chilly castle they call [[Ultima DnD Campaign/Locations/FrostFire Highlands/Frosthearth\|Frosthearth]]. It's nothing like home in [[Glaigoth\|Glaigoth]]. The walls are stone cold, and the people, well, they're not much warmer. Father said I'm here for peace, whatever that means. Corrin, the Lord's son, is around my age. I thought maybe we could be friends, but he looked at me like I'm some sort of monster. Lord Frosthearth said I would start training to be a Paladin! It's going to be cool, like the knights of Castle Starfall in all the legends. I hope I can be like them one day even if I'm green.

---

#### Entry 2: Happy Fourteenth Birthday to me!

Three years at the castle, and life here is still as frigid inside as it is outside in the Ash Wastes. Corrin hasn't changed; if anything, he's worse. Sometimes I think he's nastier than the Trickster—though I probably shouldn't say that out loud. I basically have my own corner in the library now. I've discovered all of the books about Origin and Aleph . They fought dragons and demons, while I'm stuck here with Corrin... I'd rather take on the dragons!

---

#### Entry 3: Corrin is such a dick!

During dinner today after year ten exams, [[Ultima DnD Campaign/NPCs/Bulara\|Bulara]], the kitchen maid, wore this god-awful bow in her hair but she looked so hopeful, and she's got it tough, being green like me. So I told her it was nice. I hope it made her day a little better. I always feel like she's looking at me for some reason. Corrin was there, being his usual unpleasant self, She has a name you know, she's not just "that goblin thing". He makes the Trickster seem like a saint, and that's saying something.

---

#### Entry 4: The New Guy

A new guy showed up today—[[Ultima DnD Campaign/NPCs/Hector\|Hector]]. What a breath fresh air. He's from the [[Throng\|Throng]] in the [[Everglades\|Everglades]]! How cool is that, can you imagine... tropical air, no wonder he's well.. different from the other people here and he's my age and better than everyone in training AND he doesn't take [[Corrin\|Corrin]]'s bullshit!!! Today he showed up in the library again. We actually talked about interesting stuff like Origin and that Tome in the locked up section... and I happened to know all about it because of all my reading so... We talked a bit. I tried to keep it casual, but it's hard when someone's...interesting. 

---

#### Entry 5: Hector's Impact and Corrin's Humiliation

Today they announced some big tournament that King Auralius is hosting. I guess he's granting a kingly request to the winners. I still can't believe he actually descended from from Origin, with that power, who knows what someone could request? At lunch Corrin started boasting about how he'd make his dad king of Glaigoth too, it's was almost too much but then then he told [[Ultima DnD Campaign/NPCs/Bulara\|Bulara]] to wish for a "less hideous face". I don't know what came over me but I couldn't take it anymore. I told him to shut up right to his face infront of everyone. I thought I was gonna die when [[Ultima DnD Campaign/NPCs/Hector\|Hector]] showed up beside me. You should've seen the look on Corrin's face—it was priceless.

---

#### Entry 6: Heart-to-Heart and An Unwelcome Visitor

Hector and I met in the library again, we talked about Glaigoth. It felt good to talk to someone who actually listens. Suddenly, Corrin burst in, hurling insults and disrupting the peace calling us lovebirds. They actually had to kick him out after he slammed the table though. The nerve of that guy! Then Hector asked what I'd request from the king. Honestly I don't want anything, I'd just like to see the [[Ultima DnD Campaign/Locations/Starfall Castle/Eldritch Library\|Eldritch Library]] at the castle, I've heard it's so amazing. He told me to chase my dreams... fat chance, I mustered up the courage to ask [[To be Sorted/Lord Frosthearth\|To be Sorted/Lord Frosthearth]] if I could attend the tournament. Got shot down faster than a snowball in summer. It was weird though, when I asked Hector what he would request from the King, he just said, "something that could make a real difference". How can he be so mysterious and so sincere at the same time? Ugh. 

---

#### Entry 7: The Letter

I just found a letter, from [[Ultima DnD Campaign/NPCs/Hector\|Hector]] in my dormitory!!!!!

##### Dear [[Ultima DnD Campaign/PCs/Grove\|Grove]],

I hope this letter finds you well. The whispers around the castle corridors suggest that a certain event is approaching, one filled with dance, laughter, and perhaps a bit of intrigue. I am, of course, referring to the upcoming ball haha.

Given our recent chats in the library, I thought it might be an enjoyable experience for us to attend together. If the prospect interests you, find me at the doors to the great hall and dress in your best!

Best regards, [[Ultima DnD Campaign/NPCs/Hector\|Hector]]. 

My heart's pounding. Does he actually feel this way about me? Oh Aleph help me what do I do? What do I WEAR???

---

#### Entry 8: The Night I Played the Fool

Everything is terrible, what do I do, what do I do?????

I arrived at the ball filled with a giddy mix of hope and dread, waiting for what felt like an eternity. Then [[Ultima DnD Campaign/NPCs/Bulara\|Bulara]] appeared, all dressed up, her eyes searching for mine. When she mentioned the letter I had supposedly written to her, my stomach plummeted; we'd been set up!

Before I could even stammer an apology, Corrin and his cronies appeared bursting into laughter, their eyes filled with cruel delight. Elara's face crumpled and she ran away, tears streaming down her cheeks. I felt like an empty shell, humiliated, my eyes burning with unshed tears. 

Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, Hector showed up. Corrin spun his web tighter, asking loudly, "Wait, who did you think wrote that letter, Grove?" Their eyes turned to Hector and a new wave of laughter erupted. 

Corrin revealed his vile coup de grâce. He'd planted a recording device under our library table and had overheard our private conversations. According to him, what he heard was "sickening," so he decided to put it to the test and it was true, that I was... I wanted to disappear right then and there. Hector yelled at Corrin, but Corrin had one more dagger to throw. "Friend of the trickster, eh?" he sneered. It turned out Hector had been scheming to steal the guarded tome all along. Corrin said he'd heard him late one night over the device communicating with other friends of the Trickster. He said he's been using me to get close to the Tome the whole time and that he'd probably make me take the fall for it too.

The Lord of Frosthearth arrived with his guards, and Hector was arrested. As he was led away, our eyes met. "I just wanted to make a real difference," he said softly. 

Now I sit here, alone, my quill trembling as I write. I can't stay in this den of vipers any longer. 

---

#### Entry 9: Leaving Frosthearth Behind

I'm penning these words from a dimly lit corner of a tavern, miles away from the suffocating walls of Frosthearth. I saw Hector beofre I left, his hands bound, his eyes meeting mine for the briefest moment. "I'm so sorry," he mouthed. What does that even mean? What part of this twisted tale was he sorry for?

But as I sit here, I think about Origin and his grand quest, how he overcame insurmountable odds to change the course of the world. Why can't I aspire to do the same? I don't know what awaits me at [[Castle Starfall\|Castle Starfall]], or what challenges the tournament will bring. What I do know is that I can't spend another day as a pawn in someone else's cruel game. 
So, I'm heading to the tournament. I don't know if I'll win or even survive, but at least I'll be the one writing my own story. Come what may. 

Aleph, please protect my family, please forgive me for abandoning my duty.
