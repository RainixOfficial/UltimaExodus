- **Class**: [[Wizard\|Wizard]] (Level 1)
- **Homeland**: [[Vesperia\|Vesperia]] in the [[Neon Jungle\|Neon Jungle]]

### Appearance

Davin is a slim elf with pointy ears and crinkled brown eyes. His hair is usually brushed back in a way that gives him an excuse to push it out of his eyes. He wear clothes with natural designs that give off the vibe of "forest chic." 

### Personality

Davin can find the joke in every situation. He's got this laid-back aura that can make even a spell misfire seem like part of the plan. Though he might come off as a little scatterbrained, he's deeply creative, especially when it comes to twisting magic in ways it probably wasn't intended. He's always a beat off but impossible to ignore.

### Quote

Life in Vesperia, am I right? It's like a cosmic jam session, and I'm just strumming along."

## Back Story…

In the good vibes capital of the [[Neon Jungle\|Neon Jungle]], [[Vesperia\|Vesperia]], where the wind chimes have wind chimes lived Davin. He shared a cozy, rent-troubled apartment above the "Mystic Cauldron," a potion shop run by [[Hazel\|Hazel]], a battle-axe of a hippie with a soft spot for loud music... only until ten pm. Davin, a staff member at [[Vesperia Academy\|Vesperia Academy]], was less interested in the artificing of plants and more in convincing a new spell to fold laundry and not turn his socks into smouldering ruins.

Davin was part of the band, "Heinous Anus," with his roommates [[Lyra\|Lyra]] and [[Ultima DnD Campaign/NPCs/Eldin\|Eldin]]. But with Eldin gone to [[Castle Starfall\|Castle Starfall]] to embrace his inner blacksmith, the rent was as tight. Davin's grand plan? The "GigaBloom," a plant that promised to make nectar with more Juls than jet fuel. After a presentation that included a minor explosion and major embarrassment, the academy rejected his plant, sending him away with empty pockets and a final warning.

With rent past due, and Davin was drowning his sorrows at the "Cloud Nine," when a mysterious stranger offered him cash for his volatile plant. In a a haze of smoke rings and naïveté, he accepted the deal.

Not long after, his three cantankerous blue birds went missing. When one returned, looking sicker then a celiac at the Olive Garden, Davin and Lyra sought Hazel's wisdom. She didn't know why the bird was sick, but her potion skills brought it back from the edge. Loaded with more of Hazel's brew, they followed the bird to a horrifying discovery: a new mechanical plantation ran by Luminoth's robots, oozing toxins that seemed oddly familiar.

Infiltrating the plantation, they freed the captive birds and faced down a menacing Golem. In a moment of desperation, Davin unleashed his laundry-folding spell. The birds, coming to his aid, infused themselves with the spell, transforming into feathery missiles that made the Golem crash into the computer system, totalling the plant.

Then the sickening truth revealed itself. The toxins stemmed from none other than Davin's own GigaBloom. The revelation hit harder than any drum solo Eldin ever played. Wanted by Luminoth and burdened by guilt, Davin knew he had to make things right. He decided to participate in the tournament at [[Castle Starfall\|Castle Starfall]], with one goal in mind: to ask [[Ultima DnD Campaign/NPCs/Origin/King Auralius\|King Auralius]] to destroy the GigaBloom and undo his unwitting damage.
