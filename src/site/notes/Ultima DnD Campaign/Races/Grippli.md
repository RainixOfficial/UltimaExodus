## Cultural Notes

### Homeland: [[The Throng\|The Throng]]
Grippli in Ultima mainly inhabit the kingdom of The Throng, located in the Everglades. They share this region with other amphibious and swamp-dwelling creatures. Their communities are often built into the sides of trees or in natural caverns, well camouflaged to deter predators and invaders.

### Relations with Other Races
Grippli are generally peaceful and get along well with other races, especially those who respect their wetland homes. They have a symbiotic relationship with the native amphibians of The Throng, and their societies often overlap.

### Role in Ultima
The Grippli are the stewards of the wetlands, often acting as intermediaries between the natural world and the expanding frontiers of other civilizations. Their innate understanding of the swamp and its magical properties make them invaluable allies in maintaining the balance of this unique ecosystem.
