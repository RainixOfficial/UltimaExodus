# Florien

## Introduction

Florien are a subrace of Elves deeply connected to the Neon Jungle, a realm where even normal-sized beings feel minuscule, akin to bees in a sprawling forest. They embody the essence of this vibrant and mana-rich environment. This realm consists of two primary cities: Verdantis, which lives in harmony with the jungle, and Luminoth, a cyber-punk metropolis fueled by a potent form of nectar that has transformative, addictive qualities.

## Physical Description

![Florien-20231030013239609.webp|227](/img/user/Life%20Admin/Assets/Florien-20231030013239609.webp)

Florien stand around 4 to 5 feet tall. They have delicate insect-like wings, antennae, and iridescent hair and nails. Their multifaceted eyes allow them to see in ultraviolet light.

## Society and Culture

Florien society is organized much like a bee colony, with individuals filling roles such as harvesters, caregivers, and defenders. They are a deeply communal race, sharing the responsibilities of nectar gathering and protection.

## Racial Traits

## Ultra Violet Sight

- **Range**: Ultraviolet Vision is effective up to 60 feet.

- **Nectar Detection**: Floriens can easily spot sources of nectar or high-sugar substances. They have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to finding such resources.

## [[Ultima DnD Campaign/Races/Florien Diet and Sleep\|Florien Diet and Sleep]]

#### Diet

Floriens have a metabolism that is highly reliant on simple sugars, similar to hummingbirds. They need to consume nectar, fruit juices, honey, or other high-sugar substances multiple times a day to maintain their energy levels. Due to their fast metabolic rates, Floriens are in a constant search for these sugary substances, often carrying small reserves with them when traveling.

#### Effects of Low Sugar

- **Irritability**: After an hour without sugar, a Florien becomes increasingly irritable.
- **Emotional Swings**: After two hours, emotional instability sets in.
- **Hangry**: At the three-hour mark, they become extremely hungry and angry, often referred to as "hangry."
- **Pass Out**: If they go without sugar for more than three hours, they risk passing out from hypoglycemia.

#### Torpor

Unlike the meditation of Elves, Floriens enter a state of torpor when they rest. This is a deep hibernation-like state that allows them to conserve energy. However, this comes with its drawbacks:

- **Intense Sleep Needs**: While in torpor, Floriens are almost entirely unresponsive and cannot be easily awakened. Their metabolic rate drops dramatically, allowing them to survive without food for the duration, but they are vulnerable during this period.
- **Long Recovery**: Exiting torpor is not instantaneous. It takes Floriens about half an hour to "wake up" fully and regain their normal metabolic rate.
  
In summary, Floriens live on the edge of a metabolic knife, requiring frequent sugar intake to sustain their high-energy lifestyle. Their unique state of torpor allows them to survive periods without food but leaves them vulnerable and takes time to recover from. Their dietary and rest needs make them complex creatures to interact with, always teetering on the edge of euphoria and irritability.
- Your antennae give you advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks related to smell.

### Languages

- You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and Sylvan.

### Fey Ancestry

- You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

- A roaring cyber-punk metropolis fueled by a potent form of nectar, creating a bustling pop music industry and a culture of overconsumption that is depleting the jungle's resources.
